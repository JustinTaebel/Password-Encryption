<h2>Password Checker</h2><br>
Enter in a password that is at least 6 characters long, contains one capital letter, and one symbol. Strength of password is determined based off of a point system that gives points for length, number of Capitals, numbers, and symbols. Once you put in a strong password, you have the option to encrypt.

<h2>Encryption</h2><br>
The submitted password is encrypted by going through a simple ceasar cipher algorithm with a randomly set shift variable and then displays the encrypted string. You can then decrypt it and it will replace the encrypted string with the original plain text string. If you encrypt the same password again, a different encrypted string will display, but the same password will be decrypted.
